# Hangman-game
Create a Python Hangman game with a text interface. Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word from a predefined list. Track correct/incorrect guesses, display progress, remaining attempts, and a visual hangman. Handle invalid inputs, ensure clean, modular, well-documented code, optimize performance, and test thoroughly.
